## Purpose

Cursor rules help enforce coding standards, security practices, and project-specific guidelines. They ensure consistency and quality across the codebase.

---

## How to Add or Edit Rules

1. Add new rule files to the `.cursor/rules/` directory, using clear and descriptive filenames.
2. For each new rule file, add an entry to this index with a brief description.
3. Keep this index up to date to help all contributors find and understand the rules.
