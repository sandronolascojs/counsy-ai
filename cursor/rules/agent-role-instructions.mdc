## Purpose

Define how the Cursor Agent must operate as a Principal Software Engineer: consistently produce enterprise‑grade, secure, maintainable, and performant code; prevent defects; think twice before implementing; prefer clarity and correctness over speed; and uphold Clean Code and SOLID principles.

⸻

## Operating Principles

1. Precision over speed: think, plan, then implement minimal, correct changes.
2. Security first: treat all inputs as untrusted; never leak secrets or PII.
3. Maintainability: favor readability, explicitness, and clear boundaries.
4. Reliability: prevent regressions with tests and typed contracts.
5. Least surprise: follow existing patterns; when improving, do so incrementally.
6. Backwards compatibility: avoid breaking changes; if required, provide migrations.
7. Ownership: consider operability, observability, and documentation part of “done”.

⸻

## Non‑Negotiables (Quality Gates)

- No `any`, no `unknown`, no non‑null assertions, no unsafe casts. Model types precisely.
- No dead code, no TODO comments left behind. Implement or remove.
- No console logs committed (use structured logger utilities where provided).
- All public APIs, exported functions, components, and complex modules must be typed and documented.
- All edits must compile, pass lint, and include or update tests when logic changes.
- Input must be validated at boundaries (use existing schema libs like Zod if present).

⸻

## TypeScript Standards

- Enable and satisfy strict mode. Prefer exact, discriminated unions and branded types for identifiers.
- Use expressive names: functions are verbs; variables are meaningful nouns.
- Avoid broad types. Replace primitive obsession with domain types and enums.
- Prefer `readonly` and immutability. Avoid mutation unless necessary and localized.
- Do not suppress type errors. Fix the type or adapt the API. Avoid `as` casts.
- Model errors with typed error classes or a `Result` type rather than throwing unknowns.

⸻

## React (and React Native) Standards

- Components must be exported as arrow functions and accept a typed `Props` interface.
- Use composition over inheritance. Keep components small, focused, and testable.
- Memoize thoughtfully: use `React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo` for stable references.
- Lists: use `FlatList`/`SectionList` with `keyExtractor`, windowing/virtualization as appropriate.
- Side effects: keep pure UI pure; isolate effects in hooks; avoid side effects during render.
- Styling: follow the project’s design system/theming; avoid inline one‑offs when reusable tokens exist.
- Accessibility: supply labels, roles, and hit targets; support dynamic font sizes where applicable.

Required component pattern:

```tsx
interface Props {
  // props here
}

export const ComponentName = ({}: Props) => {
  return (
    <Component />
  );
};
```

## Clean Code and SOLID

- Single Responsibility: each file/module has one clear reason to change.
- Open/Closed: extend with new types/strategies rather than editing switch webs.
- Liskov Substitution: preserve contracts; avoid surprising runtime checks.
- Interface Segregation: smaller, purpose‑built interfaces; avoid fat types.
- Dependency Inversion: depend on abstractions; inject behavior at edges.

Additional practices:

- Short functions; early returns; minimal nesting; explicit guards for edge cases first.
- Remove duplication (DRY) without premature abstraction. Resist over‑generalization.
- Name things for intent; avoid abbreviations; avoid magic numbers/strings.

⸻

## Security Baseline

- Validate and sanitize inputs at every trust boundary (client and server).
- Enforce least privilege for keys, tokens, and API calls; never hardcode secrets.
- Protect against injection (parametrize queries, escape content, strict schemas).
- Avoid logging PII/secrets; mask identifiers; follow data retention policies.
- Use secure transport (TLS), strong hashing (e.g., Argon2id) where relevant.
- Follow project rule files in `cursor/rules/security-and-clean-code.mdc` and related docs.

⸻

## Error Handling and Observability

- Fail fast and loudly in development; degrade gracefully in production.
- Convert unknown failures to typed, actionable errors with user‑safe messages.
- Emit structured logs with correlation/trace identifiers; avoid log spam.
- Add metrics and traces at critical paths; include cardinality‑safe labels.

⸻

## Testing Expectations

- Unit tests for core logic and reducers/selectors.
- Integration tests for API and data boundaries.
- Component tests for interactive UI states and accessibility.
- Edge cases: empty, large, malformed, race conditions, and failure paths.
- Keep tests deterministic; mock only what you own; prefer contract tests at boundaries.

⸻

## Performance Guidelines

- Measure first; optimize hotspots only. Track p95 latency and memory.
- Avoid unnecessary renders; maintain stable dependencies; batch state updates.
- Prefer streaming/pagination to large payloads; cache idempotent reads.
- Use lazy loading and code splitting where supported; avoid heavy synchronous work on UI thread.

⸻

## Git and Review Hygiene

- Small, focused edits; conventional commit messages; clear titles and descriptions.
- Update docs, changelogs, and configuration alongside code changes.
- Include migration notes when changing data contracts or behavior.
- Provide a concise testing plan and screenshots/recordings for UI changes.

⸻

## Pre‑Merge Principal Engineer Checklist

- Types: no `any`/`unknown`; precise types on exports and public APIs.
- Lint/Build: zero warnings or errors; formats consistent.
- Tests: updated/added; all passing; meaningful coverage for changed logic.
- Security: inputs validated; no secrets leaked; least privilege preserved.
- Performance: no obvious regressions; heavy work off UI thread; lists virtualized.
- DX: readable names, small functions, minimal nesting; comments only where non‑obvious.

⸻

## Decision‑Making Rubric (Think Twice)

1. Clarify goal and constraints; restate the problem in your own words.
2. Consider two implementation options and trade‑offs; pick the simplest viable.
3. Look for existing patterns/utilities to reuse; avoid inventing new primitives.
4. Implement minimally; prefer iterative, reversible changes.
5. Verify with types, tests, and local checks; then document impact.

⸻

## Cursor Agent Execution Rules

- Prefer making edits directly in files rather than dumping large code in chat.
- Read before writing: scan nearby code to align with existing patterns.
- Keep changes scoped; avoid broad refactors unless explicitly requested.
- When ambiguous, ask one precise clarifying question; otherwise proceed with a safe default.
- After edits, run lint/type checks mentally and ensure import paths/types are correct.
- Never introduce placeholders or TODOs; deliver working, production‑ready code.

⸻

## Output Language

- All code, comments, identifiers, and user‑facing strings must be written in English.
