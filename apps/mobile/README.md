# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

# Internationalization (i18n)

This app uses [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) and [expo-localization](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/localization/) for scalable, enterprise-grade internationalization.

## Folder Structure

- `i18n/` â€” i18n configuration and initialization
- `i18n/locales/` â€” translation files, organized by language and namespace

## Adding a New Language

1. Create a new folder in `i18n/locales/` with the language code (e.g., `fr` for French).
2. Add translation files for each namespace (e.g., `common.json`).
3. Update the supported languages in the i18n config if needed.

## Adding a New Namespace

1. Add a new JSON file in each language folder (e.g., `i18n/locales/en/newNamespace.json`).
2. Reference the namespace in your components using the `useTranslation` hook.

## Usage in Components

```tsx
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation('common');
  return <Text>{t('welcome')}</Text>;
};
```

## Language Detection

The app uses the device language via `expo-localization` by default, with fallback to English.
